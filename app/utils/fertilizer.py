        'Urea': """
        <br/> 1. Urea is a popular nitrogen-containing fertilizer that is widely used in agriculture to promote healthy plant growth and increase crop yields.

        <br/> 2. Urea is a water-soluble fertilizer, which means it dissolves in water and can be absorbed by plants through their roots.

        <br/>3. Urea can be applied to soil in a number of ways, including broadcasting it over the soil surface, incorporating it into the soil, or applying it as a side-dressing along the rows of plants.
        <br/>4. The amount of urea to apply depends on the type of crop and the stage of growth. Generally, crops require different amounts of nitrogen at different growth stages.

        <br/>5. Over-application of urea can lead to environmental problems such as nitrate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is important to apply urea in the correct amounts and at the right time to minimize its impact on the environment.""",

        'DAP': """
        <br/> 1. DAP stands for di-ammonium phosphate and is a widely used phosphorus-containing fertilizer that is often used in conjunction with other fertilizers such as urea.

        <br/>2. DAP is typically granulated, making it easy to handle and apply. It can be applied to soil in a number of ways, including broadcasting it over the soil surface or incorporating it into the soil.

        <br/>3. DAP is often used in conjunction with other fertilizers such as urea to provide a balanced supply of nitrogen and phosphorus to plants.

        <br/>4. The amount of DAP to apply depends on the type of crop and the soil conditions. Generally, it is recommended to apply DAP at the time of planting or during the early stages of growth.

        <br/>5. Over-application of DAP can lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies and soil acidification. Therefore, it is important to apply DAP in the correct amounts and at the right time to minimize its impact on the environment.""",

        <br/>1. 14-35-14 is a type of fertilizer that contains 14% nitrogen, 35% phosphorus, and 14% potassium. It is commonly used to promote healthy root growth and improve plant development.

        <br/>2. This type of fertilizer is often recommended for crops such as vegetables, fruits, and ornamental plants. It can also be used for turfgrass and lawns.

        <br/>3. The best time to apply 14-35-14 fertilizer is during the early stages of plant growth. This is when plants are most in need of phosphorus for healthy root development.

        <br/>4. 14-35-14 fertilizer can be applied in a number of ways, including broadcasting it over the soil surface, mixing it into the soil, or using it in a liquid form as a foliar spray.

        <br/>5. Over-application of 14-35-14 fertilizer can lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies and soil acidification. Therefore, it is important to apply 14-35-14 fertilizer in the correct amounts and at the right time to minimize its impact on the environment.""",

        '28-28': """
        <br/>1. 28-28 is a type of fertilizer that contains equal amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus (28% each). It is commonly used to promote healthy growth and development of plants, particularly during the early stages of growth.

        <br/>2. This type of fertilizer is often recommended for crops such as corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans. It can also be used for fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.

        <br/>3. The best time to apply 28-28 fertilizer is during the early stages of plant growth when plants are most in need of nutrients for healthy development.

        <br/>4. 28-28 fertilizer can be applied in a number of ways, including broadcasting it over the soil surface, mixing it into the soil, or using it in a liquid form as a foliar spray.

        <br/>5. Over-application of 28-28 fertilizer can lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies and soil acidification. Therefore, it is important to apply 28-28 fertilizer in the correct amounts and at the right time to minimize its impact on the environment.""",

        '17-17-17': """
        <br/>1. Composition: 17-17-17 is a complete, balanced fertilizer that contains equal parts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This makes it a good choice for general purpose use on a variety of crops.

        <br/>2. Nutrient availability: The nutrients in 17-17-17 are immediately available to plants, which makes it a good choice for a quick boost of nutrients. However, the nutrients may not last as long in the soil as other slow-release fertilizers.

        <br/>3. Application rate: The application rate for 17-17-17 will depend on the crop being fertilized and the specific nutrient requirements. As a general rule, apply 1-2 pounds of fertilizer per 100 square feet of soil.

        <br/>4. Application method: 17-17-17 can be applied by broadcasting the fertilizer over the soil surface and then incorporating it into the soil. It can also be applied as a side-dressing along the rows of crops.

        <br/>5. Precautions: Be careful not to over-fertilize with 17-17-17, as excess nutrients can leach into groundwater or runoff into nearby waterways. Always follow the recommended application rate and timing, and avoid fertilizing during heavy rainfall or when water is likely to carry nutrients away from the crop.
